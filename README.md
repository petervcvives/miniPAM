Mini personal asset management
An asset management for yourself, to manage items in your home. I wrote this as a assignment for my mico degree at the VIVES.
Becasue I could choose what to make I choose to make a mini asset management tool to manage my electronic componenets. But I can be used to manage other assets also.

I did not create a GUI for it so it will work only using the command line interface.
